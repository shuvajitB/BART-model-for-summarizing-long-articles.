This project focuses on utilizing advanced natural language
processing models, BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers), to
summarize long articles effectively. The objective is to develop a system that can
condense extensive texts into concise and coherent summaries while preserving the
essential points and overall meaning. This involves gathering a diverse set of long
articles, preprocessing the text, and fine-tuning the pre-trained BART on a summarization
dataset. Once trained, the model will generate summaries. The applications of this
project range from news aggregation and academic paper summarization to executive
summaries for business reports and content curation for social media. By implementing
BART, the project aims to create a tool that significantly reduces the time required to
understand long articles, ensuring efficiency and accuracy, and can be adapted for
specific domains to enhance summarization quality. 

For this project, I will be using the CNN/Dailymail dataset(https://huggingface.co/datasets/ZhongshengWang/Alpaca-cnn-dailymail). The CNN/DailyMail
Dataset is a collection of over 300,000 news articles written by journalists from CNN and
the Daily Mail. While it was originally designed for tasks like reading comprehension
and answering questions in an abstract way, the latest version of the dataset can be used
for both extractive and abstractive summarization. This means it can help create shorter
summaries that either pull directly from the text or generate new sentences that convey
the same meaning.
